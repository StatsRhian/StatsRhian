## Hi I'm Rhian 👋

I’m a data science leader, statistical consultant and #RStats expert, based in the U.K. I’m passionate about using statistics to help people make data driven decisions.

- 🧮 I'm a **data scientist** at [The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/), improving the robustness and transparency of analytic work within the NHS. I build open-source Reproducible Analytical Pipelines and provide public health analysts with the tools, skills, and confidence to develop their own reproducible analyses.

- 🗣️ I like **talking statistics**. I'm a [Statistical Ambassador](https://rss.org.uk/membership/promoting-statistics/rss-statistical-ambassadors/) for the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk) engaging with the media, schools and wider public to improve statistical literacy. I'm also an [regular speaker](https://rhian.rbind.io/talks) at meetups and conferences.

- 👩‍💻 I was a professional **#RStats educator** at [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/) for five years, writing and delivering training courses internationally and am a [Posit certified trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#people).

- 💜 I **value community**, and an active supporter of a number of organisations including [R-Ladies+](https://rladies.org/) and the [NHSR Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/). I'm part of the leadership team for [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.org/). If you live near Newcastle, UK you might catch me at the [North East Data Science meetup](https://www.meetup.com/newcastle-upon-tyne-data-science-meetup/).

This is what I'm up to [now](https://rhian.rbind.io/now.html).
