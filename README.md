## Hi I'm Rhian ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data science leader, statistical consultant and R expert, based in the U.K.
Iâ€™m passionate about using statistics to help people make data driven decisions.
This is what I'm up to [now](https://rhian.rbind.io/now.html).

Some personal projects:

- :rocket: Automating CPD reports with [levelup](https://github.com/statsrhian/levelup)
- :spaghetti: Collating [recipes](https://github.com/StatsRhian/recipes) I use in R Markdown
