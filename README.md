## Hi I'm Rhian ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data science leader, statistical consultant and R expert, based in the U.K.
Iâ€™m passionate about using statistics to help people make data driven decisions.
This is what I'm up to [now](https://rhian.rbind.io/now.html)

Some personal projects I'm working on:

- :speech_balloon: [Talks](https://rhian.rbind.io/talks) I've given
