## Hi I'm Rhian ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data science leader, statistical consultant and #RStats expert, based in the U.K. Iâ€™m passionate about using statistics to help people make data driven decisions.
I work at [The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/), improving the robustness and transparency of analytic work within the NHS, and supporting the [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/).
I'm also a [Statistical Ambassador](https://rss.org.uk/membership/promoting-statistics/rss-statistical-ambassadors/) for the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk) engaging with the media, schools and wider public to improve statistical literacy.

This is what I'm up to [now](https://rhian.rbind.io/now.html).

Some personal projects:

- :speech_balloon: [Talks](https://rhian.rbind.io/talks) I've given
- :rocket: Automating CPD reports with [levelup](https://github.com/statsrhian/levelup)
- :spaghetti: Collating [recipes](https://github.com/StatsRhian/recipes) I use in a quarto website
